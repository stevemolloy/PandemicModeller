# PandemicModeller
Python modelling of a national or international pandemic

## Modelling
Use households as the smallest unit.  Model how they might interact on different scales.

# Python version
Note that this code was written on Python 3.8.2.

I make use of functionality that only exists in >=3.6.
Python2 is explicitly **not** supported.  If you are still using Python2 in production, you should feel bad.
